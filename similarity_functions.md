**REQUEST:** Name all the similarity hash functions you know about which are implemented in python

# CHAT GPT RESPONSE:

There are several similarity hash functions that are implemented in Python. Here are some examples:

## Simhash
is a locality-sensitive hashing algorithm used for finding near-duplicates within a large set of documents. It is implemented in the Python library "nearpy".

## MinHash:
MinHash is a technique used to estimate the Jaccard similarity between two sets of items. It is commonly used in recommendation systems, clustering, and other applications that involve measuring similarity between sets. The Python library "datasketch" provides an implementation of MinHash.

## Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH):
LSH is a technique used to find similar items within a large set of items. It is often used in applications such as image and audio retrieval, recommendation systems, and clustering. The "pyspark.ml.feature" module in PySpark provides an implementation of LSH.

## Jaccard Similarity:
Jaccard similarity is a measure of similarity between two sets. It is often used in text analysis, data mining, and other applications that involve measuring similarity between sets. The Python library "scikit-learn" provides an implementation of Jaccard similarity.

## Cosine Similarity:
Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two vectors. It is often used in text analysis, recommendation systems, and other applications that involve measuring similarity between vectors. The Python library "scikit-learn" provides an implementation of cosine similarity.

## Levenshtein Distance:
Levenshtein distance is a measure of the difference between two strings. It is often used in text analysis, spelling correction, and other applications that involve measuring the distance between strings. The Python library "python-Levenshtein" provides an implementation of Levenshtein distance.

These are just a few examples, and there are many other similarity hash functions that are implemented in Python or available through Python libraries.
