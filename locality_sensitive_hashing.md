**REQUEST**: Supply a python implementation of  Locality-Sensitive Hashing that does not require sklearn

# RESPONSE from Chat-GPT:

Sure, here's a basic implementation of Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) in Python using NumPy, which does not require the scikit-learn library:

*See locality_sensitive_hashing.py*

Here's an example usage of this implementation:

*See lsh_example_usage.py*

Note that this implementation uses a simple hash function that just takes the sign of the dot product between a random projection vector and the input vector. More sophisticated hash functions can be used for better performance. Additionally, this implementation assumes that the input vectors are NumPy arrays. If the input data is in a different format, the hash method should be modified to handle it appropriately.
