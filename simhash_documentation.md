*See code is in simhash_function.py*

This implementation takes in a list of tokens as input and generates a hash vector of a specified size (defaulting to 64 bits). It uses the MD5 hash function to generate a 128-bit hash value for each token, and then converts this value to a binary string. The algorithm then iterates through each bit in the binary string and updates the corresponding position in the hash vector by adding 1 if the bit is 1 or subtracting 1 if the bit is 0.

Finally, the algorithm generates the final hash value by setting each bit to 1 if its corresponding position in the hash vector is greater than or equal to 0, and to 0 otherwise. This produces a 64-bit hash value that serves as the fingerprint for the input document.

### Differences between the two implementations of simhash:

**Request: are there any differences between your suggested simhash function and this one: https://github.com/1e0ng/simhash**

### Chat-GPT Plus answer:

Yes, there are some differences between the SimHash function I provided and the one in the GitHub repository you linked.

One major difference is that the GitHub implementation uses the MurmurHash3 hash function instead of the MD5 hash function used in my implementation. MurmurHash3 is a faster hash function than MD5, and is often used in high-performance applications. However, MD5 is a widely-used cryptographic hash function that is known to produce good hash values for similarity detection tasks, so its use in the SimHash algorithm is still considered valid.

Another difference is that the GitHub implementation adds an additional step to the algorithm that involves normalizing the hash vector by computing the sign of each element in the vector. This step is intended to improve the stability of the hash function, by ensuring that small variations in the input document produce only small changes in the hash value.

Additionally, the GitHub implementation allows the user to specify a weighting function to assign different weights to different features of the input document. This can be useful in cases where some features of the document are more important than others for similarity detection.

Overall, both implementations are valid implementations of the SimHash algorithm, and the choice of which one to use will depend on the specific requirements of your application.
