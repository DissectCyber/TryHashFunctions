### Why does minhash incorporate a random number?

*Chat-GPT reply:*f

Minhash is a technique used in data analysis and information retrieval to estimate the similarity between two sets. The basic idea of minhash is to generate a signature for each set by hashing the elements of the set, and then comparing the signatures to estimate the Jaccard similarity between the sets.

The reason why minhash uses a random number is to ensure that the resulting signature is as independent as possible from the ordering of the elements in the set. Specifically, the hash function used in minhash maps each element of the set to a random number, and then takes the minimum value of the resulting set of random numbers as the signature for the set.

By using a random number in this way, the order of the elements in the set becomes less important, because the minimum value is only affected by the presence or absence of an element in the set, not by its position. This helps to ensure that the resulting signature is a good approximation of the set's content, and allows the minhash technique to work effectively for a wide range of data types and applications.
